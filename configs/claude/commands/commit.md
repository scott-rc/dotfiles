# Commit

Commit any outstanding changes.

Format the commit message following this structure:

   ```
   <concise PR title - one line summarizing the change>

   <explain the motivation and reasoning behind these changes>
   ```

## Commit Message Guidelines

- **Title**: Should be a clear, concise description suitable as a PR title (ideally under 50 characters, max 72).
- **Context**: Explain _why_ these changes were made, not just _what_ changed. If you are unsure, ask the user. These lines can be longer than 72 characters as they will be wrapped by GitHub.
- **Code formatting**: Wrap all code-related text with backticks, including function names, variable names, type names, file paths, package names, flag names, and environment variables.
