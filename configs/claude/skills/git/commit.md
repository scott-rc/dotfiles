# Commit Operation

Commit outstanding changes with a well-formatted message.

## Instructions

1. **Check current branch**:
   - If on `main` or `master`, ask the user if they want to create a new branch first
   - If yes, create and switch to the new branch before committing

2. **Stage and commit changes**:
   - Review uncommitted changes
   - Stage relevant files
   - Create commit following [commit-guidelines.md](commit-guidelines.md)
