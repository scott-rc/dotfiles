# Commit Message Guidelines

Format commit messages following this structure:

```
<concise title - one line summarizing the change>

<explain the motivation and reasoning behind these changes>
```

- **Title**: Clear, concise description (ideally under 50 characters, max 72)
- **Context**: Explain _why_ these changes were made, not just _what_ changed. Ask the user if unsure.
- **Do not wrap lines**: Lines can be longer than 72 characters. GitHub renders markdown and handles line wrapping automatically.
- **Code formatting**: Wrap all code-related text with backticks (function names, variable names, type names, file paths, package names, flag names, environment variables)
