# Commit Message Guidelines

## Structure

```
<title>

<body>
```

Separate title and body with a blank line. The body is optional for trivial changes.

## Title

- Keep under 72 characters (GitHub truncates longer titles)
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be specific: "Fix null pointer in UserService.load()" not "Fix bug"

## Body

- Explain the motivation and reasoning—why these changes were made, not just what changed
- Write prose, not bullets (unless listing genuinely unrelated items)
- Use backticks for code: function names, variables, file paths, flags, etc.

## When Unsure

If the commit scope or message is unclear, ask the user before committing.
